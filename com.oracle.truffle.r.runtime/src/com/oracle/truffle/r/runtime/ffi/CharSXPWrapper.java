/**
 * Internally GNU R distinguishes "strings" and "vectors of strings" using the {@code CHARSXP} and
 * {@code STRSXP} types, respectively. Although this difference is invisible at the R level, it
 * manifests itself in the R FFI as several functions traffic in the {@code CHARSXP} type. Since
 * FastR already uses {@code String} to denote a length-1 string vector, it cannot be used to
 * represent a {@code CHARSXP}, so this class exists to do so.
 *
 * N.B. Use limited to RFFI implementations.
